# Efficient Detection of DDoS Attacks Using Machine Learning

This project aims to efficiently detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using various machine learning algorithms. The system is built to analyze network traffic data and classify it as normal or malicious based on a rich set of features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. **Model Training**: Applying different ML models to detect DDoS attacks.
4. **Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
5. **Comparison**: Analyzing model performance to choose the best detection method.
